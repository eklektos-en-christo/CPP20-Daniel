Polymorphism : Base ptr/ref to derived objects, related to inheritance

A Base ptr/ref can handle the derived objects

Use : code reusability, we can use base code again and again with derived objects, we don't
have to setup additional code for each derived type

We can also store different types of objects in an array, though it is not allowed to store
different types in an array, but we can store the base pointers to derived objects in a single
array of base pointers

Polymorphism : multiple forms

reduced code redundancy

final and override are not keywords : they are identifiers, C++11
