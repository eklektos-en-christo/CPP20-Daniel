Coroutines - designed to do asynchronous programming much easier, they are a generalization of C++
functions

functions:
- can be called
- can return a value

C++20
- can be paused
- can be resumed

Coroutine workflow: any of the below keywords in a function makes the function a coroutine

co_yield - suspends the execution and returns a value
co_return - completes the execution and returns a value
co_await - suspends the execution until it is resumed

exceptions - what can't be a coroutine
- constexpr functions
- ctors
- dtors
- main function
