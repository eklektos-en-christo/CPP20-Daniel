Modules : they change the compilation model of C++ program

problems with headers:
preprocessor pastes the included headers' code into the source file, there are ODR violations if
 a definition appears in multiple files, order of the definitions also matter when using header
 files

a definition in one module is constrained only that module, same definition in another module will
be a different definition

Module interface file .ixx - acts as a header file, anything in it is constrained to this file only
any other interface file that has the same definitions will be constrained to that file only

Binary interface file - binary representation of .ixx file, compiler processes the .ixx file into a
binary format and any files importing .ixx file will reference the binary interface file, it can be
reused by multiple files
